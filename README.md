# Neural Networks From Scratch

# About

I am implementing neural networks from scratch using Numpy. I started with a lovely book called "Neural Networks From Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça.

## The project covers the following concepts

- Dense layer
- Activation Functions
    - ReLU
    - Sigmoid
    - Softmax
    - Linear
- Loss Functions
    - Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
    - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
    - Mean Absolute Loss
    - Mean Squared Loss
- Optimizers
    - SGD
    - Adagrad
    - RMSProp
    - Adam
- Dropout
- L1 and L2 regularization
- Backpropagagtion
- MNIST Dataset

# To Do

- Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network

# MNIST Dataset
